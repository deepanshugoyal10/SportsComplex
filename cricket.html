<h1><marquee scrollamount="15">WELCOME TO CRICKET</marquee></h1>
<p>In terms of the concept of the game indoor cricket is similar to cricket. Like its outdoor cousin,<br>
 indoor cricket involves two batsmen, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler bowls the ball<br>
 to the batsmen who must score runs.The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins.<br>
 Despite these basic similarities, the game itself differs significantly from its traditional<br>
 counterpart in several ways, most notably on the field of play and the means by which runs are obtained.
</p>

<h2><b>Playing Arena</b></h2>
<p>
The length of an indoor cricket pitch is the same as a conventional cricket pitch, and has 3 stumps at each end,<br>
but there the similarities end. The arena is completely enclosed by tight netting, a few metres from each side<br>
and end of the pitch. The playing surface is normally artificial grass matting. Whilst the pitch is the same length,<br>
however, the batsmen do not have to run the entire length. The striker's crease is in the regulation place in front of<br>
the stumps, but the non-striker's crease is only halfway down the pitch.</p>
