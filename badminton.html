<h1><marquee scrollamount="15">WELCOME TO BADMINTON</marquee></h1>
<p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets<br>
 to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played<br>
 with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" <br>
(with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). <br>
Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach;<br>
 formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking<br>
 the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half<br> of the court.

Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. <br>
Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called <br>by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.</p>
